<div class="abstract">
<div class="abstract-title">Abstract</div>
<p>We describe laboratory experiments to elucidate the relationship
between nonlinear elasticity and permeability evolution in fractured
media subjected to local stress perturbations. This study is part of an
effort to measure fluid pathways and fracture properties using
active-source acoustic monitoring during fluid injection and shear of
rough fractures. Experiments were conducted with L-shaped samples of
Westerly granite fractured in-situ under tri-axial conditions with
deionized water subsequently circulated through the resulting fractures.
After in-situ fracturing, we separately imposed oscillations of the
applied normal stress and pore pressure with amplitudes ranging from 0.2
to 1 MPa and frequencies from 0.1 to 40 Hz. In response to normal stress
and pore pressure oscillations, fractured Westerly granite samples
exhibit characteristic transient softening, acoustic velocity
fluctuations, and slow recovery, together with permeability enhancement
or decay, informing us about the coupled nonlinear elastodynamic and
poromechanical rock properties. Fracture interface properties (contact
asperity stiffness, aperture), are then altered in-situ by shearing,
which generally decreases the measured elastic nonlinearity and
permeability change for both normal stress and pore pressure
oscillations.</p>

<p>Dynamic stresses associated with energy production and waste water
sequestration (injection, pumping, and transport of supercritical <span

important contributor to injection-induced seismicity <span

et al. 1968; Raleigh, Healy, and Bredehoeft 1976; Simpson, Leith, and
Scholz 1988; Sminchak and Gupta 2003; McNamara et al. 2015; McGarr et
al. 2015; Walsh and Zoback 2015)</span>. These perturbations can cause
significant changes in the local stress field and poromechanical
properties in the subsurface and therefore act as a diagnostic for
impending fault reactivation and prospective changes in permeability -
among other utilities. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how fluid
injection influences the hydromechanical properties of rocks and, in
particular, associated fractures. Natural and anthropogenic sources of
dynamic perturbation each impact poromechanical properties through
similar mechanisms and in similar ways, suggesting uniform controls
relating nonlinear stiffness to poromechanical properties. We
characterize these dependencies to define the potential to link
nonlinear acoustic properties to the evolution of reservoir state and
behavior.</p>
<p>Empirical evidence from the field and laboratory show that
earthquakes and subsequent seismic waves cause transient changes in rock
stiffness in the proximity of faults. Specifically, field observations
document a sudden reduction in elastic wave velocity associated with
co-seismic softening and a post-seismic recovery of rock stiffness that
is logarithmic in time e.g., <span class="citation"
data-cites="Brenguier08">(Brenguier et al. 2008)</span>. Similar
observations have been made in the laboratory <span class="citation"
data-cites="Elkhoury11">(Elkhoury et al. 2011)</span>. Moreover, lab
studies using dynamic acousto-elastic testing <span class="citation"
data-cites="Shokouhi17">(Shokouhi et al. 2017)</span>, show that
ultrasonic wave velocity decreases during dynamic stressing and then
recovers with the logarithm of time. These studies show that dynamic
strains on the order of <span class="math inline">\(10^{-6}\)</span> are
sufficient to cause the nonlinear elastic effects <span class="citation"
data-cites="Guyer09 Riviere15">(Guyer and Johnson 2009; Jacques Riviere
et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>The nonlinear behavior of rocks is sensitive to both fine-scale
features and second-order constitutive effects, such as fracture
apertures (impacting flow pathways, asperity stiffness) and nonlinear
stiffness (impacted by rate-dependent friction and healing). In order to
fully understand the ramifications of dynamic stressing in the
subsurface, we need to elucidate the relationship between the
elastodynamic and hydro-mechanical properties of fractured rocks.
Currently, the literature characterizing relationships between
elastodynamic and poromechanical response and subsequent recovery is
limited <span class="citation" data-cites="Shokouhi20">(Shokouhi et al.
2020)</span>. We present results from sophisticated and
highly-constrained laboratory experiments in which we combine the
analysis of nonlinear elastodynamic and hydraulic data.</p>
<p>In this paper we briefly revisit experimental results from <span
class="citation" data-cites="Shokouhi20">(Shokouhi et al. 2020)</span>,
but expand the focus with additional measurements of imaging acoustic
nonlinearity across a fracture using multiple P-polarized lead-zirconate
(PZT) transmitter-receiver pairs. Also, we relate the average nonlinear
acoustic response to fracture permeability as an averaged hydraulic
measurement. Another important parameter that we analyze is how the
fracture recovers from dynamic stressing. Most importantly, we
investigate the effect of shearing on elastodynamic and hydraulic
properties of fractures. This is central to this work in that shearing
considerably modulates the fracture interface, generating wear material
(gouge, breccia) and changing contact asperities, respectively in
qualitative terms, which has the objective of simulating conditions
found in the subsurface.</p>
<h1 id="sec:experimnt_setup">Experimental Setup</h1>
<p>We conducted laboratory experiments in a true triaxial configuration
using fractured granite samples in-situ while simultaneously measuring
flow rate and nonlinear elastic properties. Samples of Westerly granite
were cut into L-shape blocks (69 x 45 x 50 x 26 mm, Figure <a
href="#fig:samplesetup" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:samplesetup">1</a>) with 3 mm deep notches on the
top and base to guide the evolution of planar fractures driven by shear
loading to failure. The L-shape is used for maintaining constant nominal
contact area during both initial fracture then shear. Our samples were
saturated with deionized water (submerged in water for 24 hours) and
then placed between steel loading platens with embedded piezoelectric
transducers. The PZTs from APC International Ltd. are 6.5 mm in
diameter, with a center frequency of 500 kHz and are epoxied in blind
holes 4 mm from the rock sample (Figure <a href="#fig:samplesetup"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:samplesetup">1</a>). The
loading platens contain internal conduits to provide a line source of
fluid at either end of the fracture plane. Fluid access at both ends of
the fracture was via a narrow channel (45 x 1 mm) fitted with sintered
porous fits (permeability <span class="math inline">\(\approx
10^{-14}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(m^2\)</span>) and fed by
five 1.6-mm diameter holes, as shown in Figure <a
href="#fig:samplesetup" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:samplesetup">1</a>e. Deionized water was pumped
through the fracture at constant pressure drop using independent high
speed servo-controllers for both inlet and outlet pressure (Figure <a
href="#fig:samplesetup" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:samplesetup">1</a>).</p>
<p>The experimental apparatus consists of a stiff load frame and two
hydraulic pistons capable of applying force in either displacement- or
load-control mode and a pressure vessel with independent control of pore
and confining pressures. Applied forces are measured using custom-built,
beryllium-copper strain-gauge load cells mounted on each loading piston.
The load cells have an amplified output of <span
class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span>5 V with an accuracy of <span
class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span>5 N and are calibrated with a
Morehouse proving-ring. Displacements are measured with direct-current
displacement transducers (DCDT), with an accuracy of <span
class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 0.1 <span class="math inline">\(\mu
m\)</span>. Confining pressure was created using a food-grade heat
transfer oil (XCELTHERM 600, Radco Industries). A linear variable
differential transformer (LVDT) was attached to the sample inside the
pressure vessel to accurately (<span class="math inline">\(\pm 0.1\ \mu
m\)</span>) measure changes in fracture dilation/closure. Pressure
intensifiers fitted with LVDTs and pressure transducers were used to
control the confining pressure and the internal upstream and downstream
fluid pressures.</p>
<p>Each axis of loading is independently servo-controlled and all
stresses, strains, fluid pressures and fluid volumes were recorded with
a <span class="math inline">\(\pm10\)</span> V, 16-channel 24-bit
analog-to-digital converter at 10 kHz and averaged to sampling rates of
100 Hz or 1 kHz, see Figure <a href="#fig:data_aq"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:data_aq">2</a> for
schematic of data acquisition system. Fluid flow across the fracture was
measured using upstream and downstream pore-pressure intensifiers and
the permeability was subsequently calculated. Active ultrasonic data
were recorded using a Vantage<sup>TM</sup> Research Ultrasound
(Verasonics) system. We use broadband (<span
class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>0.02-2 MHz) PZTs (APC International
Ltd. 6.35 mm diameter compressional crystals), which were successively
pulsed every 1 ms on the transmitting side and recorded at the receiver
side with a sampling rate of 25 MHz. The input signal is a half sine
with a frequency of 500 kHz. Also, external triggers sent at regular
intervals (of order 1 s) by the Verasonics system were recorded by the
24-bit analog-to-digital data acquisition system. This provided a means
for synchronizing the fast-sampled “ultrasonic” and lower sampled
“poro-mechanical” data. We used these data to measure changes in the
permeability and elasticity of the fractured rock samples.</p>

analog-to-digital converters at 10 kHz and averaged to sampling rates of
100 Hz or 1 kHz. An LVDT (shown as red cylinder) was used to measure the
dilation/compaction of the fracture. Active ultrasonic data were
recorded using a Vantage TM Research Ultrasound (Verasonics) system.
Also, the Verasonics system sends external triggers at regular intervals
(<span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> 1s) that are recorded by
the 24-bit analog-to-digital data acquisition system. This allows
synchronizing of the ultrasonic data to the poro-mechanical data and
then their joint analysis.</figcaption>

<h2 id="experimental-procedure">Experimental Procedure</h2>
<p>Each experiment commenced with extensive sample preparation in which
the Westerly granite was cut and notched, sealed in a latex jacket, and
then placed inside the pressure vessel. The latter was filled with
confining fluid before a horizontal stress of 20 MPa was applied. We
chose this confining stress such that our results can be compared with
previous experimental work <span class="citation"
data-cites="Candela14 Candela15">(Candela et al. 2014, 2015)</span>.
Confining fluid pressure was slowly increased to 15 MPa afterwards. We
then applied pore pressure: inlet (<span class="math inline">\(P_{pA
}\)</span> = 4 MPa) and outlet (<span
class="math inline">\(P_{pB}\)</span> = 2 MPa). At this state there was
no flow because the Westerly granite matrix permeability is very low
(<span class="math inline">\(&lt; 10^{-20}\ m^2\)</span>) and the
confining fluid pressure (around the jacketed sample) is greater than
the pore pressure, preventing the short-circuiting flow of water around
the sample.</p>
<p>A shear load was then applied with the vertical piston in
displacement mode at a constant rate of 10 <span
class="math inline">\(\mu m/s\)</span> for a total of approximately 4 -
5 mm. Samples fractured in-situ after reaching a critical stress of
<span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span>55 MPa (see inset of Figure
<a href="#fig:exp_seq" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:exp_seq">3</a>c and Figure S2), after which we
locked the vertical piston. Fluid flow and acoustic emissions were
measured during fracture, but here we focus on dynamic stressing which
was implemented via oscillations of the effective normal stress.</p>
<p>Oscillations of the applied normal stress were applied with the
horizontal loading piston at prescribed amplitudes (0.2 to 1 MPa) and
frequencies (0.1, 1, 10, 40 Hz). Pore pressure oscillations were
achieved by oscillating <span class="math inline">\(P_{PA}\)</span> at
amplitudes of 0.2 to 1 MPa and frequencies of 0.1, 1, 10 Hz while
holding <span class="math inline">\(P_{PB}\)</span> constant. Multiple
sets of normal stress and pore pressure oscillations of varying
amplitudes and frequencies were applied to investigate: (1)
repeatability and direct comparison between the two modulated stresses
(normal stress and pore pressure) and (2) amplitude and frequency
dependencies of the measured response. Post-fracture dynamic stressing
is plotted in Figure <a href="#fig:exp_seq" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:exp_seq">3</a>d and shows the normal stress (red)
and pore pressure (blue) oscillations. To investigate the effect of
shearing and resulting changes in fracture properties (heterogeneous
aperture, flow pathways, contact asperities) and generated wear material
on elastic nonlinearity and permeability, the sample was sheared in two
4 mm (held at <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{NS}\)</span> = 20
MPa), stages, which are shown for experiment p4975 in Figures S3-S4..
After each shearing stage the oscillation protocol was applied to the
sample. Initially, the in-situ fracture was quite rough with fines
throughout, but the effect of shear reduces and changes this roughness;
the old contacts were broken and new contacts formed, changing the
extent to which the two halves of the fracture were mated. Throughout
shear the size, shape, and amount of wear products, or fines,
continuously evolves and likely has a complicated effect on fluid flow,
see Figure S1 for qualitative evidence of wear material generated during
experiment p4975. These measurements allow investigation of how fracture
properties are related to the elastodyamic and hydromechanical
properties.</p>

<h2 id="permeability-measurements">Permeability Measurements</h2>
<p>We measured flow rates independently at the fracture inlet (<span
class="math inline">\(Q_A\)</span>) and outlet (<span
class="math inline">\(Q_B\)</span>) using the outputs of LVDTs on the
pressure intensifiers, see Figure S3. After verifying the steady state
flow condition (<span class="math inline">\(Q_{A} - Q_{B}  \leq 5
\%\)</span>), Darcy’s law was used to calculate permeability <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>:</p>
<div class="linenomath*">
<p><span class="math display">\[\label{eq:perm}

<p>where <span class="math inline">\(Q = \frac{1}{2} (Q_A + Q_B
)\)</span> is the average flow rate (<span
class="math inline">\(\frac{m^3}{s}\)</span>), <span

class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the flow path given by the length of
the sample (50 mm) and <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is the
cross-sectional area perpendicular to the flow path (45 x 26 <span
class="math inline">\(mm^2\)</span>). Specifically, <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the bulk permeability, that is, the
permeability of the surrounding rock matrix (on order of <span
class="math inline">\(10^{-21} m^2\)</span>) and of the fracture.
Alternative calculations of permeability are valid <span
class="citation" data-cites="Zhang17 Ishibashi18">(Zhang et al. 2017;
Ishibashi et al. 2018)</span>, however we are interested in relative
changes in permeability in response to dynamic stressing, rather than
the absolute value of fracture permeability.</p>
<h2 id="ultrasonic-measurements-active-source">Ultrasonic Measurements:
Active Source</h2>
<p>Ultrasonic waves transmitted through the fracture were recorded
continuously in each experiment. Half-cycle sinusoidal pulses with an
amplitude of 40 V and center frequency of 500 kHz were emitted
consecutively from each transmitting transducer (9 piezoelectric discs
arranged in a 3 x 3 matrix embedded within the right-hand loading platen
in Figure 1c) with a pulse repetition frequency of 100 Hz or 1000 Hz
during the low and high frequency (<span class="math inline">\(\geq
10\)</span> Hz) stress oscillations, respectively. The waveforms were
amplified (<span class="math inline">\(\sim 40\)</span> dB) and recorded
for all the receiving transducers (12 piezoelectric discs arranged in a
4 x 3 matrix embedded within the left-hand loading platen in Figure 1c).
In this study we utilized 1 transmitter and 3 receivers. Details of the
ultrasonic data analysis are shown in in Figure <a href="#fig:xcor_poly"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:xcor_poly">4</a>. Figure
<a href="#fig:xcor_poly" data-reference-type="ref"

stress oscillation, red, and the received waveforms (decimated) in the
same time domain. Two signals highlighted in green and yellow are
projected down to Fig. <a href="#fig:xcor_poly"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:xcor_poly">4</a>b to
demonstrate the connection between time shift, velocity, and the
influence of the stress perturbation. The changes in ultrasonic wave
velocity are determined by first calculating the time shift by the
cross-correlation of each received signal with a reference waveform. The
reference waveform is generated by averaging 50 waveforms at the
beginning of each experimental run, when there are no stress
oscillations. The window of cross-correlation is chosen to include the
p-wave arrival to the end of of one period, as shown in Figure <a
href="#fig:xcor_poly" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:xcor_poly">4</a>c. Since the calculated time shifts
are typically on the order of 1 ns, smaller than the sampling rate of 5
MHz, the estimation of the time shift is improved by fitting the peak of
the cross-correlation function with a second order polynomial, Figure <a

<h1 id="results">Results</h1>
<p>We combine ultrasonic data, strain measurements, and permeability to
document the nonlinear elastodynamic response and poromechanical effects
of dynamic stressing. Here, we draw from an extensive set (<span
class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span>10) of experiments, calibrations, and
tests to focus on data from two distinct experiments with a range of
stressing amplitudes, frequencies, and shearing.</p>
<h2 id="sec:results-nonlin_hydr_response">Nonlinear elastodynamic and
hydraulic responses</h2>
<p>Linear elasticity does not fully describe the behavior of rocks
especially if they are fractured, highly stressed or subject to
large-amplitude dynamic stressing. Even undamaged rocks exhibit a range
of nonlinearity due to a variety of structural features such as
microcracks and soft grain boundaries <span class="citation"
data-cites="Riviere15">(Jacques Riviere et al. 2015)</span>. When
fractured or damaged, the nonlinearity of the rock is further affected
by contact acoustic nonlinearity at fracture interfaces. The
characteristic responses to dynamic stressing (transient softening,
velocity modulation, and slow recovery) as shown in Figure <a
href="#fig:delc_delk_calc" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:delc_delk_calc">5</a>, are indicative of nonlinear
mesoscopic elasticity <span class="citation" data-cites="Guyer09">(Guyer
and Johnson 2009)</span> and highly informative on rock micro-structure,
fractures, and inter-grain contacts. Crucially, these are the features
that also control the hydraulic properties of rock. Therefore, instead
of analyzing the linear elastic response (wave speed and amplitude), we
focus on the nonlinear elastic response i.e., the stress-dependency of
wave speed and amplitude.</p>
<p>Through our active source ultrasonic monitoring we characterize the
elastodynamic properties of the fractured Westerly granite by
quantifying its response to dynamic stressing. Figure <a
href="#fig:delc_delk_calc" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:delc_delk_calc">5</a> demonstrates typical recorded
elastodynamic and hydraulic responses to a 1 Hz, 1 MPa normal stress
oscillation in experiment p4966. We characterize the elastodynamic
response with three parameters to describe the nonlinearity, <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta c/c_0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(dc/c_0\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta A/A_0\)</span>. To calculate <span
class="math inline">\(c_0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span>, we choose 1-s time windows that are
short enough to capture pre- and post-oscillation values but long enough
to provide averaged values not affected by local fluctuations in the
data. Wave velocity changes from its initial value <span
class="math inline">\(c_0\)</span> to a new steady-state value <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> in response to a perturbation and <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta c\)</span> is calculated as the average
wave velocity over the oscillation duration excluding two cycles in the
beginning and the end. We quantify the difference <span
class="math inline">\(c - c_0\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta c\)</span>. In the case of Figure 5, the
velocity decreased from about 4383.5 m/s to about 4832 m/s after the
normal stress oscillation ended, so <span class="math inline">\(\Delta c
\approx 1.5\ m/s\)</span>.</p>
<p>The RMS wave amplitude, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, is
calculated in the time domain in a window comprising the first arrived
p-wave, see Figure <a href="#fig:xcor_poly" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:xcor_poly">4</a>c. Dynamic stress oscillations
result in a sudden decrease in amplitude relative to the initial value
<span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span> to a new temporary
non-equilibrium state. Therefore, both <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta c/c_0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta A/A_0\)</span> represent nonlinear ratios
that demonstrate the transient effect of dynamic loading on fracture
stiffness, for a range of stress amplitudes and frequencies. Although
RMS amplitude can be extracted from our data, that is not the main focus
of this paper, but some results are reported in the Supporting
Information in Figures S6-S7. Another nonlinearity parameter that we
identify is modulation of the wave velocity, <span
class="math inline">\(dc\)</span>, during oscillations at frequencies
that are harmonics of the driving frequency. This quantity represents
the average amplitude of wave velocity modulations during dynamic
perturbations after the system reaches a non-equilibrium state. Finally,
after being stressed, the fractured rock exhibits long-term “recovery”
trending toward the initial <span class="math inline">\(c_0\)</span>
value, in which the wave velocity or amplitude evolves to a new steady

<span class="math inline">\(c_0\)</span> is well described by a
logarithmic function of the form <span class="math inline">\(c_r = \dot

<p>The stress-induced changes in permeability are captured by two
parameters: (1) The transient change in permeability <span

to the imposed normal stress or pore pressure oscillations, normalized
by the pre-oscillation permeability <span

data-reference="fig:delc_delk_calc">5</a>c <span class="citation"
data-cites="Candela14">(Candela et al. 2014)</span> and (2) the linear
in log time rate of permeability recovery after the transient increase
<span class="math inline">\(\dot k\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(k_r = \dot k\ \log{t} + b_2\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(\dot k\)</span> is the slope (recovery rate) and
<span class="math inline">\(b_2\)</span> is the intercept. Figure <a
href="#fig:delc_delk_calc" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:delc_delk_calc">5</a> shows the pre-oscillation
permeability <span class="math inline">\(k_0\)</span> and the
post-oscillation permeability <span class="math inline">\(k = k_0 +
\Delta k\)</span> calculated by averaging the measured values over 10-
and 1-s time windows. Calculation discontinuities in permeability
measurements shown in Supplemental Figure S3 correspond to times for
which inlet/outlet flow rate difference exceeds the 5% threshold that we
impose to ensure steady state flow. Permeability during dynamic
stressing is indeterminate because there is no steady-state flow and the
diffusion time across the fracture is slower than the higher oscillation
frequencies (10 and 40 Hz).</p>
<p>To better illustrate how the elastodynamic and hydraulic properties
of fractured rock change in response to dynamic perturbation we show an
excerpt from the post-fracture stage of experiment p4975 in Figure <a
href="#fig:NS_p4975_run3b_01Hz" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:NS_p4975_run3b_01Hz">6</a>. Figure <a

data-reference="fig:NS_p4975_run3b_01Hz">6</a> demonstrates how the
inlet and outlet flow rates evolve during a 0.1 Hz normal stress
oscillation; three colorbars highlight zoomed cycles in Figure S6. Note
the clear evidence of compression and tension in the fracture normal
displacement with increased and decreased normal stress (Figure 6). The
inlet <span class="math inline">\(Q_A\)</span> flow rate is in phase
with the imposed stressing, but the outlet flow <span
class="math inline">\(Q_B\)</span> is 180 out of phase and of a much
smaller magnitude than that of the inlet. These observations demonstrate
the magnitude of changes we are characterizing and also reinforce that
the fracture is continuously evolving during the dynamic perturbations;
contacts undergo compression and tension resulting in changing fluid
flow paths along the fracture. In subsequent subsections we discuss how
nonlinear elastodynamic and hydraulic parameters <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta c/c_0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta k/k_0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(dc/c_0\)</span>, and <span

pore pressure oscillation amplitudes and frequencies. We also discuss
how these results are affected by shearing for both experiments p4966
and p4975.</p>

id="dynamic-stress-induced-changes-in-permeability-and-wave-velocity">Dynamic
Stress-induced Changes in Permeability and Wave Velocity</h2>
<p>Changes in fracture closure cause both changes in permeability and
stiffness. A more complete understanding of both physical phenomena is
important for understanding processes that control energy production
from, and waste storage in, the subsurface. In this section, we report
and compare the stress amplitude and frequency dependencies for both
sets of parameters. Although these experiments pertain to different
samples/fractures, both are composed of the same rock type, and the same
loading conditions were used to produce the shear fractures.</p>
<p>The dependency of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta k/k_0\)</span>
on the amplitude of normal stress and pore pressure oscillations is
shown in Figure <a href="#fig:perm_ns_amp" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:perm_ns_amp">7</a>, which additionally
differentiates the order in which the 1 Hz oscillations sets were
imposed. We observe that the relative permeability change <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta k/k_0\)</span> scales with the amplitude of
1 Hz normal stress oscillations and, to a greater degree, pore pressure
oscillations in the post fracture case. Another interesting observation
here is that the order in which oscillations were applied has an effect
on the permeability enhancement/reduction. The first pore pressure
oscillation set generally produces the largest permeability enhancement
in the post-fracture case, but this is not observed for normal stress
oscillations, where the second set is the most effective. This is likely
due to how the pore pressure and normal stress oscillation sets were
alternated during the experiments, see Figure <a href="#fig:exp_seq"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:exp_seq">3</a>d. The 1 Hz
normal stress oscillations (increasing amplitude) are separated by
successive pore pressure oscillation sets, rather than performing all of
one oscillation type and then the other in each part of the
experiments.</p>
<p>After shearing the fractures (5 mm in p4966 and 4 mm in p4975) the
relationship between permeability enhancement and oscillation amplitude
deteriorates. The post-shear normal stress oscillations sets cause no
permeability enhancement with increasing amplitude, but noticeable
reduction at larger amplitudes (<span
class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span>1 MPa). Though there is no clear
linear trend, pore pressure oscillations are still able to enhance
permeability in the first post-shear set. Another observation here is
that permeability enhancement is less influenced by normal stress
oscillation order compared to the pore pressure oscillations. After the
second set of shear, both pore pressure and normal stress oscillation
resulted in permeability reduction for nearly all amplitudes.</p>

period just after the fracture formed (post-fracture) and after each
increment of shear. Comparing post-fracture results to post-shear we
observe a general reduction of permeability enhancement via dynamic
stressing with smaller values of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta
k/k_0\)</span>. Gouge generated from shear is likely clogging flow
pathways along the fracture plane. The hypothesized impediment to flow
for the post-shear oscillation sets causes a reduction in permeability
enhancement, especially for the post-shear 2 oscillation
set.</figcaption>

data-reference="fig:delc_ns_amp">8</a>. As expected <span
class="citation" data-cites="Riviere15">(Jacques Riviere et al.

<span class="math inline">\(\Delta c/c_0\)</span>) with oscillation
amplitude for both normal stress and pore pressure. In this measure of
fracture nonlinearity there is a clearer trend between oscillation order
and magnitude, for this transmitter-receiver path. For both oscillation
types (normal and pore pressure), subsequent sets of oscillation reduce
the magnitude of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta c/c_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, shear displacement scarcely changes the magnitude of
nonlinearity (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta c/c_0\)</span>) with
respect to the post-fracture case, especially for normal stress
oscillations in experiment p4975. Another interesting observation from
this transmitter-receiver pair is an increase in nonlinearity from
post-fracture to post-shear 1 in experiment p4966. In the next section,
we report other transmitter-receiver pairs across the fractures.</p>

Variations of the Nonlinear Elastodynamic Response</h2>

data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:delc_ns_amp">8</a>
corresponded to a single pair of transducers. To further our
understanding of the coupling between elastodynamic and hydraulic
response to dynamic stressing, we investigate the spatial variations of
the elastic response along the fracture by analyzing all available
transmitter-receiver pairs measurement of wave velocity (Figures <a

data-reference="fig:delc_plots_ns">9</a> – <a href="#fig:delc_plots_pp"

Figures <a href="#fig:delc_plots_ns" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:delc_plots_ns">9</a> and <a
href="#fig:delc_plots_pp" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:delc_plots_pp">10</a> show a coarse view of the
nonlinear elastodynamic response across the fracture as a function of
applied oscillation amplitude. Note that data point shape corresponds to
oscillation frequencies. The direct path sensor (blue PZT in Figures <a
href="#fig:delc_plots_ns" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:delc_plots_ns">9</a> – <a href="#fig:delc_plots_pp"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:delc_plots_pp">10</a>)
results were discussed in the previous section. The focus here is to
describe observations regarding the other transmitter-receiver paths,
that is the heterogeneity of the fracture interfaces. The other sensors
measure larger differences in values and also more linearity in the case
of the bottom sensor in p4975. The second shear displacement reduces
nonlinearity (direct pair) and modestly increases nonlinearity (top
sensor path), but does not have an overall coherent trend for both
experiments and all increments of shear. The response to pore pressure
oscillations, Figure <a href="#fig:delc_plots_pp"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:delc_plots_pp">10</a>,
shows more coherent results as compared to applied normal stress. Again,
large amplitude and high frequency oscillations generally produce the
largest magnitude of relative change in velocity. This particular
measurement of nonlinear elasticity is noticeably lower in experiment
p4975 for the bottom receiver path. Another important observation is
that shearing has little effect on the magnitude of nonlinearity for
pore pressure oscillations. There are instances of large differences in
nonlinearity at a particular amplitude and frequency (10 Hz for
example), which are a function of oscillation set order. Generally,
subsequent oscillation sets produce less nonlinearity, though this is
not always the case.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:delc_plots2" data-reference-type="ref"

measurement averaged over the fracture plane, to the change in wave
velocity <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\Delta c/c_0}\)</span>
averaged across all receiver locations. The data point shapes again
correspond to the oscillation frequencies and their sizes correspond to
oscillation amplitude. The main observation for the post-fracture
oscillation sets is that relative changes in permeability and wave
velocity are highly connected. That is to say, larger normal stress or
pore pressure oscillation amplitudes and frequencies produce larger
transient softening and permeability enhancement for two separate
experiments (different fractured samples). Overall, shearing weakens
this relationship, reducing the amount of nonlinearity and permeability
enhancement for both methods of dynamic stressing. Though, in the case
of normal stress oscillations, the relationship with amplitude and
frequency still exists, but the overall slope decreases due to shear
displacement.</p>

<h2 id="wave-velocity-modulation">Wave Velocity Modulation</h2>
<p>The direct effect of dynamic stressing is an instantaneous modulation
in wave velocity at harmonic frequencies of the driving frequency. We
denote the mean velocity amplitude as <span

in average velocity oscillations <span
class="math inline">\(dc/c_0\)</span> is a proxy for the nonlinear
parameter <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, estimated from the
second harmonic (e.g., <span class="citation"
data-cites="Guyer09 Riviere13 Riviere15">(Guyer and Johnson 2009; J.
Riviere et al. 2013; Jacques Riviere et al. 2015)</span>). We observe a
monotonic relationship between the magnitude of <span
class="math inline">\(dc/c_0\)</span> and oscillation amplitude for both
rock samples (Figure <a href="#fig:dc_plots2" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:dc_plots2">12</a>).</p>
<p>There is a consistent trend that subsequent oscillation sets decrease
the magnitude of nonlinearity of <span
class="math inline">\(dc/c_0\)</span> for normal stress modulation. Pore
pressure oscillations exhibit little to no change through subsequent
repetitions, except for larger driving amplitudes. Shearing the fracture
generally decreases the measured nonlinearity, especially for experiment
p4966 (Figure <a href="#fig:dc_plots2" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:dc_plots2">12</a>). The trend is not as strong for
p4975, where little to no change in <span

first shear increment. Then, after the second shear, pore pressure
oscillations interestingly increase the nonlinearity.</p>

oscillation order. The results from pore pressure oscillations in p4966
tell a similar story as the normal stress oscillations, but the pore

material) recover from dynamic stresses. We observe that the magnitude
of the log-time permeability recovery increases with pore pressure
oscillation amplitude (see insets of Figure <a href="#fig:k_recov"

our observations for post-shear are limited, the measurements suggest a
decreasing rate of recovery as a result of shearing the fracture, as

<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>Nonlinear elastic behavior of rocks is sensitive to fine-scale
features, such as fracture aperture (impacting flow pathways, asperity
stiffness) and nonlinear stiffness (impacted by rate-dependent friction
and healing). We report the relation between changes in wave velocity
and permeability in response to dynamic stressing and shearing.
Furthermore, the heterogeneous measurements along multiple
transmitter-receiver ray-paths across the fracture help illuminate the
underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>We show shearing the fracture significantly reduces the permeability
enhancement as a function of amplitude oscillation, especially for
normal stress oscillations, Figure <a href="#fig:perm_ns_amp"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:perm_ns_amp">7</a>.
Another observation is that alternating between pore pressure and normal
stress oscillations and/or subsequent sets of oscillations increases the
magnitude of permeability enhancement for normal stress oscillations
(post-fracture), but reduces permeability enhancement from pore pressure
oscillations, noticeable even in the first post-shear experimental runs.
This may be influenced by the wear material, gouge, generated at the
fracture interface during shear clogging and unclogging fluid pathways
along the fracture. Measurements of nonlinearity (<span
class="math inline">\(\Delta c/c_0\)</span>) of the fracture interface,
show that shearing the fracture modestly decreases the nonlinear
response for both types of oscillations. Again, we find that the order
of oscillation appears to have an effect on the evolution of the
fracture interface by reducing the magnitude of nonlinearity (<span
class="math inline">\(\Delta c/c_0\)</span>) for oscillation amplitudes
(normal stress and pore pressure). Perhaps, that particular fracture
properties changed (more asperities in contact, different amount of
gouge material) after shearing to produce a greater degree of
nonlinearity; further experiments could allow us to determine the
mechanism for this change.</p>
<p>The distinct transmitter-receiver ray paths reveal fractures with
highly heterogeneous properties as the relation between <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta c/c_0\)</span> and oscillation amplitude
varies greatly for both normal stress and pore pressure perturbations,
Figures <a href="#fig:delc_plots_ns" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:delc_plots_ns">9</a>-<a href="#fig:delc_plots_pp"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:delc_plots_pp">10</a>. The
observed differences are not completely unexpected given that fractured
Westerly granite samples (Figures <a href="#fig:samplesetup"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:samplesetup">1</a>c and
S1) have a heterogeneous aperture and irregularly distributed wear
products (Figure S1), especially following the application of shear
displacement. This is perhaps due to the fracture interface not being in
contact compared to the rest of the fracture. Furthermore, there is much
more similarity in results for the separate experiments than observed in
the normal stress oscillations. It is conceivable that shearing widens
the aperture in some locations, which could be filled with wear/gouge
material or remain empty, while other parts of the fracture aperture
could become closed. These possibilities may be partially responsible
for the complicated behavior we observe.</p>
<p>To “predict" permeability change from nonlinear acoustic
characterization of dynamically stressed fractured (and sheared) rock,
we relate the relative velocity change (<span
class="math inline">\(\Delta c/c_0\)</span>) to the permeability changes
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta k/k_0\)</span> and the recovery rates
of velocity and permeability. Previous experimental work suggest that
changes in permeability during pore pressure oscillations results from
unclogging fluid pathways, or conduits containing gouge material <span
class="citation" data-cites="Candela14 Candela15">(Candela et al. 2014,
2015)</span>. Other experimental work <span class="citation"
data-cites="Shokouhi20">(Shokouhi et al. 2020)</span> and current
results challenge this as the sole mechanism since normal stress
oscillations consistently produce permeability enhancement
post-fracture. This can be seen in Figure <a href="#fig:delc_plots2"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:delc_plots2">11</a>, where
the average magnitude of nonlinearity (<span
class="math inline">\(\Delta c/c_0\)</span>) increases with permeability
enhancement for both normal stress and pore pressure oscillations.
However, after shear, the relationship changes such that there is less
nonlinearity (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta c/c_0\)</span>) and
less permeability enhancement, especially for normal stress
oscillations. Subsequent shearing continues this trend of reduced
nonlinearity and permeability reduction. Overall, these results suggest
normal stress oscillations, opening and closing mechanism of the
fracture, is less effective in mobilizing fines to migrate along the
fracture conduits, pathways, as more gouge is ostensibly created with
shearing the fracture. Pore pressure oscillations are more effective in
mobilizing the fines, thus allowing for a more rapid recovery to its
initial state. Perhaps there is a complex interplay between gouge
mobilization enhancing the permeability, but also reducing the fracture
interface contact area, thus decreasing wave velocity as shown in Figure

<p>The direct effect of dynamic stressing is quantified as the mean
velocity amplitude as <span class="math inline">\(dc\)</span>, a proxy
for the second harmonic nonlinear parameter. There is a clear monotonic
relationship between <span class="math inline">\(dc/c_0\)</span> and
oscillation amplitude (normal stress and pore pressure) for both rock
samples (Figure <a href="#fig:dc_plots2" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:dc_plots2">12</a>). Shearing decreases this measure
of nonlinearity for normal stress oscillations, but slightly increases
for pore pressure oscillations (p4975). We conjecture that the two types
of dynamic stressing activate two different mechanisms: (1)
opening/closing of pore throats from normal stress oscillations and (2)
directly dislodging and mobilizing fines along the fracture from pore
pressure oscillations.</p>
<p>In this study, we also measure the log-time recovery of permeability
and velocity after dynamic stressing. These results show that larger
pore pressure oscillation amplitudes increases (the absolute value of)
the rate of recovery. After shearing we observe slower log-time
evolution of permeability, though our observations are very limited in
this case. There is perhaps a complex effect from deformation of
fracture asperities and the granular wear material that inhibit the
recovery from the transient response to dynamic stressing. We
hypothesize that the wear material comminuted as a result of subsequent
shearing and normal stress oscillations, is transported along the
fracture during the pore pressure oscillations, and impedes a recovery
from the transient change.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>We report laboratory experiments to determine the effects of dynamic
stressing and shearing on elastodynamic and hydraulic properties of
fractured rock. Monitoring in-situ fractures with active source
ultrasonic transmission and fluid permeability during dynamic stressing
driven by both normal stresses and fluid pressures reveals the complex
relation between elastodynamic and hydraulic properties.</p>
<p>In response to oscillations of effective normal stress, fractured
Westerly granite samples exhibit characteristic transient softening,
acoustic velocity fluctuations, and slow recovery, informing us about
microstructure and contact mechanics. As found in <span class="citation"
data-cites="Shokouhi20">(Shokouhi et al. 2020)</span>, large amplitude
and high frequency oscillations generally increase permeability, with
pore pressure oscillations producing the largest enhancement of
permeability. In this study, we add to previous work <span
class="citation" data-cites="Shokouhi20">(Shokouhi et al. 2020)</span>,
by analyzing the effect of shearing on the elastodynamic and hydraulic
properties of fracture rock. Furthermore, we document spatial
variability in elastodynamic properties across the fractured samples,
revealing the effect of changes in fracture properties (such as contact
asperity stiffness, aperture). We find that shearing generally decreases
the relative velocity change (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta
c/c_0\)</span>) for both normal stress and pore pressure oscillations.
The underlying physics remain unclear as to how fracture nonlinearity
parameters (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta c/c_0 , dc/c_0 , \dot
c\)</span>) are correlated to hydraulic properties (<span
class="math inline">\(\Delta k/k_0 , \dot k\)</span>) resulting from
dynamic stressing and fracture interface change (shearing). However, we
hypothesize that the fracture dilation and compaction (heterogeneous
aperture change) dominate during applied normal stress oscillations and
clogging/unclogging dominates during pore pressure oscillations and
these phenomena are related to the underlying mechanisms responsible for
the observed nonlinearity and permeability changes.</p>
<p>Further experiments are warranted to decouple the effect of gouge
material evolution and fracture asperities from the log-time recovery of
permeability and velocity. We will develop methods to collect fine gouge
material generated from in-situ fracturing and shearing in the
downstream pore pressure lines in an attempt to quantify the degree to
which unclogging mechanisms are responsible for the results we observe.
Another way of investigating the effect of gouge transport is to
systematically vary the thickness of a synthetic gouge layer of
pre-fractured granite samples. Future experiments with pre-fractured
samples will include characterization of surface roughness with
high-resolution profilometry to better constrain the underlying
mechanics of aperture and permeability change.</p>
