            <h2>Carbon minearalization and reaction-driven cracking</h2>

            <p>The purpose of this research is to investigate the chemo-mechanical processes occurring when CO<sub>2</sub>, water, and ultramafic rocks interact. 
                A lot of interest revolves around such geological systems because when the CO<sub>2</sub> is injected into volcanic rocks and basalts, it forms carbonates that will sequester the CO<sub>2</sub> in the subsurface with no risk of 
                leakage [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254120301674">1</a>, <a href="https://eos.org/articles/good-news-rocks-crack-under-pressure-from-mineral-co2-storage">2</a>]. 
                Under certain conditions, the formation of some carbonates can weaken the ultramafic rocks that are often mined to obtain metals and critical minerals. 
                To understand these chemo-mechanical processes, I have designed and built an pressure vessel with the capability of simulating sub-surface stresses and inecting carbonic acid (CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O) rock core plugs of serpentinized dunite from Canada that are targets for Nickel extraction. 
                While injecting the carbonated water, I concurrently monitor acoustic emissions, indicative of crack formation (mineralization-driven cracks), the changes in elastic properties, and the permeability of the fractured rock. 

                <p>The purpose of these multi-month injection experiments and &microCT scans is to find the conditions where poromechanics and reaction kinetics are favorable to reaction-driven cracking. 
                    The implication of this process is <i>connected fractures and pores</i> and concomitant <i>enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> storage</i>. This also weakens ultramafic cores that are otherwise uneconomical to mine and may provide opportunities for novel critical mineral leaching methods.</p>
