### Professional Work
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Geosciences Department at Pennsylvania State University. My research aims to elucidate the relationship between fractured rock elastic properties and fluid transport using well-controlled experiments in the Penn State Rock and Sediment Mechanics Laboratory. Recently, I have been using numerical modeling, constrained by experimental results.
