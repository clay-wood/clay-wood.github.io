### Professional Work
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Geosciences Department at Pennsylvania State University. My research aims to elucidate the relationship between fractured rock elastic properties and fluid transport using well-controlled experiments in the Penn State Rock and Sediment Mechanics Laboratory. Recently, I have been using numerical modeling, informed by experimental results, to better understand the complicated interplay between fracture stiffness and permeability.

### Personal Details
I have had a lot of fun hiking and camping with friends and family in the area, especially in [Rothrock State Forest](https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateForests/FindAForest/Rothrock/Pages/default.aspx). Also, my wife and I enjoy tending to our vegetable gardens -- we particularly like to grow hardy vegetables like squash.
